# MFF-Net：Semantic Segmentation of Buildings in Remote Sensing Images
Semantic Segmentation Code for Buildings in Remote Sensing Images,This repository does not contain comparison test code.
## Datasets
We use the ISPRS Potsdam and Vaihingen remote sensing datasets for experiments,Dataset download address:   
https://www.isprs.org/education/benchmarks/UrbanSemLab/2d-sem-label-potsdam.aspx
### Data description
The data Vaihingen set contains 33 patches (of different sizes), each consisting of a true orthophoto (TOP) extracted from a larger TOP mosaic, see Figure below and a DSM.  For further information about the original input data, please refer to the data description of the object detection and 3d reconstruction benchmark.  The data Potsdam set contains 38 patches (of the same size), each consisting of a true orthophoto (TOP) extracted from a larger TOP mosaic, see Figure below and a DSM. 
### Data preparation
After downloading the data set from the official website, split it according to the size of 520*520, and divide it into training set, verification set and test set according to 8:1:1.

## Environment
``torch==1.10.0  torchvision==0.11.1``  
Environment configuration reference [requirements.txt](https://github.com/zhaowqiu/MFF-Net/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.
## Training
Download pretrained weights [resnet50.pt]().  
  Run [train.py](https://github.com/zhaowqiu/MFF-Net/blob/main/train.py) after modifying the pre-training weight path.  
    Log files are saved in the log folder.
## Verification
Modify the test set path of the [vaildation.py](https://github.com/zhaowqiu/MFF-Net/blob/main/validation.py) file to test the performance of the trained model.  Modify the trained model file path

## save_weights
This folder is used to hold the model files used in the project. These files contain trained machine learning models, pretrained models, or other related model files. You can put these model files in the src directory for easy project use and management.
## train_utils
The `train_utils` folder contains utility functions and modules related to training machine learning models. It includes evaluation and validation functions along with commonly used evaluation metrics for model performance analysis.

### Evaluation and Validation Functions
The `train_utils` provides a set of functions for evaluating and validating machine learning models. These functions help in assessing the performance of the models on unseen data and verifying their generalization capabilities.

### Evaluation Metrics
In addition to evaluation functions, `train_utils` also offers a range of evaluation metrics commonly used in machine learning tasks. These metrics provide quantitative measures to assess the model's performance in various domains such as classification, regression, and clustering.

Some of the evaluation metrics included in `train_utils` are:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Feel free to explore the files in the `train_utils` folder to utilize these evaluation and validation functions as well as the evaluation metrics in your machine learning projects.
## Feature Map Analysis

The feature map analysis Python files in this repository provide tools and functions to analyze and visualize feature maps generated by deep learning models. These files help in understanding the learned representations within the neural network and gaining insights into the model's decision-making process.

### Key Features
- Functions to extract and visualize feature maps at different layers of a neural network.
- Heatmap generation to highlight important regions of the feature maps.
- Activation maximization techniques to visualize the patterns that maximally activate specific neurons.
- Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) implementation for visualizing important regions contributing to model predictions.

Feel free to explore the feature map analysis Python files to gain a deeper understanding of your models and analyze the learned representations.  
`analyze_feature_map.py` `analyze_heatmap.py` `analyze_kernel_weight.py`  
The heat map results are saved in the `heatmap` folder.
